        <h2>How to Write Poetry for the First Time: A Five-Minute Guide</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with Inspiration</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find something that moves you emotionally—an experience, a memory, or a scene.</li>
                    <li>Jot down words or phrases that come to mind when you think about this inspiration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Choose Your Form</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decide on a poetic form. Beginners might start with free verse for flexibility.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, try structured forms like haikus, sonnets, or limericks for a challenge.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Write a Rough Draft</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t worry about making it perfect. Write down your thoughts in a flow.</li>
                    <li>Let your emotions and ideas pour onto the page without overthinking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Imagery and Emotion</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use vivid imagery and sensory details to create a picture in the reader’s mind.</li>
                    <li>Express your emotions clearly and honestly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Revise and Edit</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read your poem out loud to hear how it sounds.</li>
                    <li>Make changes to improve the rhythm, word choice, and overall impact.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to make significant changes—poetry often evolves through revision.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Share and Get Feedback</strong>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keep Practicing</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing poetry is a skill that improves with practice.</li>
